**Basic Instructions - FOR APPLE ONLY:**
	At app start you will prompted for IP Address, App Id and Token.
	I have created a hidden macro to populate the required fields.
		To activate the macro, type the four digits ' 9502 ' in the App Id field.  It will then populate the AppId, and both Token fields.
			IP Address: not required for cloud access
			App Id:  1 (this will change from the code of 9502 to 1
			Token: will populate with the required token
			Cloud Token: will populate with the required token
			IP Allowed should NOT be selected
			Cloud Allowed should be selected
	Press (Select) Test Cloud Connection
		This will pull data from my development hub.  The display should tell you that 30 or so devices were identified.
	Press (Select) Save Change
This will save the config data and start communications with the hub
